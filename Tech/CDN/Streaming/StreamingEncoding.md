There are many different kinds of video encoding formats, but each is composed of two main parts: **a codec** and **a container.**
## Codec
A codec (coder/decoder) is a method for compressing and decompressing data so that it can be easily transported and received by different applications. Separate codecs are used to compress audio and video files
Two type:
- Lossly
- Lossless
### Video Codec format
- H.264 
- H.265 (HEVC)
- VP9
-  AV1
### Audio codec format
- AAC
## Container
A container combines an encoded audio stream (audio codec), encoded video stream (video codec), and metadata in a single video file.
**The metadata** tells the video player how to coordinate different audio and video codecs and may also provide additional elements, such as subtitles or alternate audio streams.
Each container supports a different range of video codecs. Some containers only work with a single type of codec and video player, which drastically limits playback options. Other containers are compatible with many types of video codecs and players.

## Video format
**MP4**: It compresses audio and video separately, which allows MP4 files to retain relatively high video quality after compression. Most browsers and iOS/Android devices are compatible with MP4 files.
**MOV**: it can run on both Mac OS and Windows OS. Only support QuickTime video players. Keep video quality=> not compress much
**AVI**: focus on  quality => video file are larger
**FLV**: lossless video. Not suport any more and cannot play on Apple devices
**WebM**: highly adaptivity to devices => competitor of MP4

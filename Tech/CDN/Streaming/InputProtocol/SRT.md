## Secure Reliable Transport (SRT)
SRT is a relatively new streaming protocol release in 2017
- It’s an open-source technology that aims to minimize the effects of jitter,  bandwidth changes, and packet loss to optimize the streaming experience.
- SRT supports all types of video and audio codecs. It also supports all transport and package formats. However, Haivision does not specify playback support and the segment duration for SRT.
